Performed ETL on multiple datasets related to jobs, skills and job details.
Performed the basic cleaning on the datasets using python and later moved on to powerBI to perform the ETL.

The powerBI account is created by my student ID and might not be accessible for everyone due to it's limitations. But I do have a pdf for one of the role(Data scientist) and it's respective details exported as a pdf.
